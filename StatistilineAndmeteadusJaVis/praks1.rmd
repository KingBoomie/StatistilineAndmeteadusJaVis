This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **R Tools | Publish | Preview** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(cars)
x <- c(1,2,3,4,5,6)
```

You can also embed `mean(x)` plots, for example:
$$\frac{1}{2} + \frac{3}{4}$$

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
